# minions

Evil, friendly, and obedient immutable CSS class selectors.

```html
<div class="p-1"> This element has 1em of padding</div>
<div class="b-1p"> This element has a 1px border</div>
<div class="m-1r"> This element has 1rem margin</div>
<div class="m-1r m-2r@sm"> This element has 1rem margin on mobile and a 2rem margin for anything above </div>
<div class="p_05">
  <div> Every direct child of this element has .5em of padding</div>
  <div class="p-0!"> ...but not this one. It's been reset to 0 </div>
</div>
```

## prior art

* [tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) - This is the first library I'd seen that went completely down the rabbit-hole of Atomic CSS with media-queries.
* [gravitons](http://jxnblk.com/gravitons/) - Brent's projects are some of my favorite on the internet. Gravitons and [basscss](http://www.basscss.com/) make an elegant and minimal framework.

### experimentation

If you want to use something in your app, use those. Calling this repo a library is an overstatement. It's a brain dump. I love the existing libraries but they fail my particular use case in two ways:

* support for legacy apps - "Mobile first" isn't possible in 10-year old app.
* "guessable" class names - I want class names that are internally consistent. I want virtually 0 abstraction between a rule I'd type in CSS and a minions class name.

## goals

* "immutable", single-property classes
* whatever-first. mobile-first, wearable-first, mega-widescreen-first, toaster-first, who cares?
* "guessable" class names
* the best of inline-styles plus media queries

## why?

That's a great question.

I've come to believe that the biggest problem with CSS is that you have to name things to do anything. People suck at naming things and only the best people go back to reconsider.

This approach allows you to defer naming thing... maybe indefinitely.

## syntax
    {property-shortand}-{value-shorthand}

#### property-shorthand

In the majority of cases, properties get shortened to a single character per word.

    display  = d
    overflow = o
    margin   = m
    padding  = p

Properties with two words (separated by a dash) will have two characters.

    border-color = bc
    border-width = bw

Likewise specific properties get a character for each dash-delimited word.

    border-top-width    = btw
    border-right-width  = brw
    border-bottom-width = bbw
    border-left-width   = blw

`x` and `y` have been added as aliases for `left & right` and `top & bottom`, respectively, for box-model properties.

    border-left-width && border-right-width  = bxw
    border-left-top   && border-bottom-width = bxw

Where there is a conflict, the basic rules should still apply. `background-color` is an example where another shorthand is needed, to avoid conflicts with `border-color`. Here I've used `gc` for `background-color` because `bc` is taken by `border-color`.

    bc = border-color
    gc = background-color

Another conflict is with `border-radius`, conflicting with `border-right`. I've used `bs` here.

    br = border-right
    bs = border-radius

Sadly, these exceptions just have to be memorized and internalized. Fortunately, there aren't many of them.

#### value-shorthand

In the majority of cases, values get shortened to a single character per word.

    1px = 1p
    hidden = h
    inline-block = ib

`em` is used for measurement shorthand. `em`s are a sensible default because they are always a multiplier of font-size. At some point I'll likely variations of this library with other defaults. Until then, the other measurement values are suffixed.

    1px = 1p
    1rem = 1r
    1em = 1

#### measurements

There is no additional abstraction between measurement values and class selectors:

    1em = 1
    .5em = 05
    .25em = 025

    1rem = 1r
    .5rem = 05r
    .25rem = 025r

I could see this feeling cumbersome to some. I'll likely add some abstracted values (e.g., `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`) as an option.

#### opacity/lightness

For values of opacity and lightness, the unsuffixed value is the default value and those suffixed with a number represent a point value.

    .c-l   { color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%)
    .c-l.5 { color: hsl(0, 0%,  50%)
    .c-l.0 { color: hsl(0, 0%,   0%)

    .o   { opacity: 1 }
    .o.5 { opacity: .5 }
    .o.0 { opacity: 0 }

Out of the box, only classes for 10ths are provided. But This can easily be extended to fit your needs.

    .c-l.42 { color: hsl(0, 0%, 52%) }
    .c-l.13 { color: hsl(0, 0%, 13%) }

    .o.42 { opacity: .42 }
    .o.13 { opacity: .13 }

#### negative

There is only one number prefix. `n` may be used to prefix a number as `negative`. I'm avoiding the use of `-` to prevent confusion with OOCSS-style classes that use the `--` (double-dash) delimiter as a modifier.

    .o-1  { order: 1 }
    .o-n1 { order: -1 }

#### theming

The ability to theme minions is important. There's a simple convention for themeable values. If the value side of the `-` isn't abbreviated, it's themeable. Everything else is static. Here's an example:

    .c-r   /* static, don't touch this */
    .c-red /* variable. theme the shit out of this one */

## property lexicon
    ai  = align-items
    as  = align-self
    b   = bottom
    bc  = border-color
    bs  = border-radius *
    bw  = border-width
    c   = color
          cursor
    d   = display
    f   = float
          flex
    fb  = flex-basis
    fd  = flex-direction
    ff  = font-family
    fs  = flex-size
        = flex-style
    fw  = font-weight
          flex-wrap
    gc  = background-color *
    jc  = justify-content
    l   = left
    lh  = line-height
    lst = list-style-type
    m   = margin
    o   = opacity
          order
          overflow
    p   = padding
          position
    r   = right
    t   = top
    ta  = text-align
    td  = text-decoration
          transition-duration
    tp  = transition-property
    tt  = text-transform
    ttf = text-timing-function
    us  = user-select
    v   = visibility
    va  = vertical-align
    w   = width
    zi  = z-index

    * see #property-shorthand section for why these are named strangely

### attributes

Attributes are hi-level modifiers to certain low-level classes.

    .fd-r.-row-gutter-1    = a 1em horizontal gutter between flex rows
    .fd-c.-column-gutter-1 = a 1em vertical gutter between flex columns

### Measurement

```css
/* 0 */
p-0 { padding: 0 }

/* px */
p-1p { padding: 1px }
p-2p { padding: 2px }
p-3p { padding: 3px }
p-4p { padding: 4px }

/* em */
p-025 { padding: .25em }
p-05  { padding: .5em }
p-1   { padding: 1em }
p-2   { padding: 2em }
p-3   { padding: 3em }

/* rem */
p-025r { padding: .25em }
p-05r  { padding: .5em }
p-1r   { padding: 1em }
p-2r   { padding: 2em }
p-3r   { padding: 3em }
```

## Padding

Padding has a few extra rules. It does so to minimize the need for negative margin. I really hate negative margin.

Where `_` is used as a delimiter, all rules are applied to direct children.

Those children can override these rules with a `!` suffix. This makes it clear when a child is acting outside of it's parents requests. Enough bangs and it might be time to change the parent's mind.

```html

<div class="p_0">
  <div> all direct children have 0 padding </div>
</div>

<div class="p_1">
  <div> all direct children have 1em padding </div>
</div>

<div class="p_1p">
  <div> all direct children have 1px padding </div>
</div>

<div class="p_1r">
  <div> all direct children have 1rem padding </div>
</div>
```

The inner elements can force their padding rules to override their parents:

```html
<div class="p_1">
  <div> all direct children have 1em padding </div>
  <div> this one two </div>
  <div class="p-0!"> this one has reset to 0 </div>
</div>
```

## Media Queries

The primary advantage that these classes provide over inline-styles is there ability to leverage media-queries.

Breakpoint-specific classes are suffixed with an `@`-symbol, followed by the two-character shorthand for the breakpoint (i.e., `mn`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`).

For example, this element becomes darker at every available breakpoint.

```html
<p class="c-l c-l.8@sm c-l.5@md c-l.2@lg c-l.0@xl">
  The wider I get, the darker I become
</p>
```

### Matching

With the right matching, this library can support legacy apps with a "whatever-first" approach. Here's what I'm thinking:

#### Additive match

    .pr-1r@sm

#### Reverse Additive match

    .pr-1r@!sm

#### Exact match

    .pr-1r@=sm

#### Exclude Exact match

    .pr-1r@!=sm

### Breakpoints

I've used the breakpoints from [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) because it's the most popular CSS framework on the planet. If you dont like them, feel free to modify that single line in your local copy.

    xl >=1200
    lg >=992
    md >=768
    sm >=544

I've added two additional breakpoints:

    xs >=320
    mn >=0   (min)
